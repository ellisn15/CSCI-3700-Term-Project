## Data-intensive Application Selection

**What are its characteristics?** 

A record company needs a way to manage its music inventory. 

**What makes it data intensive?**

It is data intensive because it handles huge amounts of data - namely songs. With songs constantly being added/removed from the database

The end users would be the record company since they will be the ones adding/removing songs from the database.

**How will they benefit?**

They will benefit from this because they can easily keep track of information on their songs.
